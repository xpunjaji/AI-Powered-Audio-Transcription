    "## Conclusion\n",
    "This project successfully implements an **AI-powered audio transcription system** using **AssemblyAI** and **Streamlit**. The application allows users to upload audio files, process speech-to-text conversion, and extract key highlights, making it a practical tool for content creators, researchers, and businesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits\n",
    "- **Automated Speech Recognition (ASR)**: Converts audio to text with high accuracy.\n",
    "- **Interactive Web UI**: Enables easy audio uploads and real-time transcription.\n",
    "- **Key Highlights Extraction**: Identifies important parts of the transcript.\n",
    "- **Secure API Integration**: Uses `.env` files to protect API keys.\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Can be extended to support multiple languages and large-scale datasets.\n",
